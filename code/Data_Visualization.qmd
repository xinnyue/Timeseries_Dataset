This plot shows the average temperature for ocean and land from 1900 to 2022. From the plot, it can be observed there is a clear rising trend from 1900 to 2022. Before 1940, the surface temperature are all below 0°C; however, after 1980, the surface temperature are all above 0°C and increasing significantly. The highest temperature appeared in 2016 March which because it was summer in the Southern Hemisphere. To compare the same month between the 1900-1940 with 1980-2022, The lowest temperature appeared in March in the first period (1900-1940), but the March become to the highest temperature month in the second period (1980-2022), which is a horrible phenomenon. Oceania had its fourth-warmest March and Asia had its ninth-warmest March on record. The Temperature in 1917 was -0.64°C, and it went up to 1.31 in 2016. The average surface temperature was increased 1.95°C in 100 years, even though this was the comparison between the lowest to highest, but it is still an evidence for the earth are much more warmer than before.

The Living Planet Index (LPI) gauges the condition of worldwide biodiversity. This index takes into account 31,821 populations of 5,230 different species, and it factors in species richness by giving greater importance to taxonomic groups with a greater number of species in both land and aquatic environments. The ZSL and WWF developed a methodology that combines the population trends of these species to generate biodiversity indexes.

The dashboard are created by three different plots: time series plot of upper and lower index from 1970 to 2018, average LPI of different regions, and sum of upper and lower living planet index for different regions. From the time series data, there are obviously downtrend for both of the upper and lower LPI, which means the diversity of the planet was decreasing significantly and it still in the downward trend and the diversity of the planet will less and less. From the bubble plot, we could find the LPI for different regions. The Europe and Central Asia has the highest average LPI compare to other regions, whereas the Latin America was the lowest. The reason is because of the climate of the Europe and Central Asia are stable and appropriate for planet to live. The Latin America has the one of the most abundant diversity of planet of the world, one possible reason for the LPI was the lowest in it was there are many species were already extincted since the temperature are increasing globally. The third plot shows the sum of the upper and lower LPI for different regions. We can see that even the India has the third highest upper LPI but the lowest LPI was the second last, which means some planets were almost extincted in India since the climate change or other reasons.

## Sea-level Plot

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
## read cse file
sea <- read_csv("~/Desktop/GU/ANLY560/560Project/Timeseries_Dataset/data/sea-level.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
## rename column names
colnames(sea) <- c("Year","Adjusted_sea_level", "Lower_error_bound", "Upper_error_bound")

## plot
plot_sea <- plot_ly(sea, x = ~Year, y = ~Adjusted_sea_level, type = 'scatter', mode='lines', name = "sea level", line = list(color = "#2c7ba8"), fill="tonexty",fillcolor = '#94bed6')
plot_sea <- plot_sea %>% layout(title = "Global Sea Level Changes between 1880-2021",
                                xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
                                yaxis = list(title = "Inches"),
                                showlegend = TRUE)
plot_sea
```

The plot shows the changes of sea level from 1880 to 2021. The plot was clearly in a uptrend and the sea levels increasing significantly from 1887. The sea levels increased around 8 inches in 150 years. The number is terrible and it means there were a lot of islands has disappeared or is disappearing. To look at the temperature plot and sea level plot together, we could found that they are all in the uptrend, which means the temperature increasing caused melting of iceberg and polar ice caps, and the temperature of the upper layer of the ocean are increased. The sea levels increased cause flooding some low-lying coastal areas and increases storm surge intensity and frequency. The sea level still in an increasing trend and the trend is inescapable.

As known, the main cause of these changes is from human activities, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, the plots are used the dataset of carbon dioxide emissions to check out the emissions by different region and time.

The first plot is a world map which can be used to observed the distribution of the carbon dioxide by different countries. There is a question in my guide questions: "What does energy consumption contribute climate change in different countries?" These plots can be used to answer this question. Carbon dioxide emissions are related to the populations. From the plots we could found that the populous country with the more carbon dioxide emissions, such as China, U.S. and India. For the bar plot, there shows the sum of the carbon dioxide emissions clearly of different countries. The highest country of carbon dioxide emissions is China, which is 212,227 MtCO2e, and the second one is the U.S. which is 177,781 MtCO2e. The third plot shows the time line of the carbon dioxide emissions for different countries. The U.S. is in a very stable situation, and China is in a uptrend and increased significantly. China exceeded the U.S. became the first one of the CO2 emissions in 2005. However, China is the most populous country and the emissions per person is not very high than other countries. Several countries are contribute much green gases for climate changes, and the UN has specific strategy for the countries who produce a lot of gases.

## Health Data Plot

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
## read cse file
health <- read_csv("~/Desktop/GU/ANLY560/560Project/Timeseries_Dataset/data/heat_deaths.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
## rename column names
colnames(health) <- c("Year","death_allyear","death_summer")
#head(health)
## plot
plot_health <- plot_ly(health, x = ~Year, y = ~death_allyear, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines',line = list( width = 1.5),
                showlegend = TRUE, name = 'Heat Death All Year') %>% 
  add_trace(y = ~death_summer, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines',line = list(color = 'rgba(191, 16, 27, 0.8)'),showlegend = TRUE, name = 'Heat Death in Summer')%>% 
  layout(title = "Heat Related Death in U.S. From 1979 to 2018",
        xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
        yaxis = list(title = "Death Rate(per million people)"))

plot_health

```

The plot used data collected by the CDC on "heat-related" deaths in the United States. It displays the rate of heat-related deaths from 1979 to 2018. The blue line shows the number of deaths where heat was the primary cause of death throughout the year, while the red line represents deaths where heat was either the main or contributing factor between May and September. It is important to note that data for May to September is only available from 1999 onwards, as the World Health Organization revised the classification of deaths in 1998 and 1999. As a result, it is difficult to compare data from before and after 1999 due to changes in the method used to classify deaths. Nonetheless, we can observe that the rate of heat-related deaths between May and September is higher than the annual rate, and there is a clear increasing trend in the data with some seasonality.

```

Financial data for ExxonMobil is obtained from Yahoo Finance. It is worth noting that ExxonMobil is the largest carbon footprint company in the United States. By analyzing the stock plot for ExxonMobil, we can observe that the stock price had an upward trend from 2002 to 2008, followed by a period of decline, and then remained stable for some time. However, there was a significant drop in the stock price at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This was a common occurrence in the stock market due to the pandemic's impact on the global economy. Nevertheless, the stock price of ExxonMobil recovered quickly and has been steadily increasing since then. To gain further insight, we can use the smoothing moving average line of MA-20 and MA-100. The larger the number, the smoother the line, and by checking the 100-day moving average, we can see that the overall trend is upward, with a notable drop in 2020. However, the stock price has since rebounded strongly and continues to rise.
